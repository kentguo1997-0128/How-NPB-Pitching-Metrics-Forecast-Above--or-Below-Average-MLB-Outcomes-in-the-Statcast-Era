# How-NPB-Pitching-Metrics-Forecast-Above--or-Below-Average-MLB-Outcomes-in-the-Statcast-Era
This study examines whether proxy advanced pitching metrics from Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) can predict Major League Baseball (MLB) outcomes during the Statcast era. Using logistic regression on 18 NPB pitchers who transitioned to MLB between 2015 and 2025, the analysis identified Left-On-Base Percentage (LOB%) as a significant predictor of above-average MLB performance (FIP ≤ 4.20), with Home Run to Fly Ball Percentage (HR/FB%) as a complementary indicator. The model achieved strong discriminatory capacity (AUC ≈ 0.88), offering academic insight and practical value for MLB scouting of NPB pitchers. It was further applied to 2026 NPB prospects, illustrating its use for forward-looking player evaluation.
